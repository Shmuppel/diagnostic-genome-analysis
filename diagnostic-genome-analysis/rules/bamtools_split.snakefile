rule bamtools_split:
    """
    Splits the reads of a sample into separate bam files, one file per chromosome.
    
    Input: 
        The mapped, marked reads of a sample contained in a BAM file.
    
    Output: 
        Multiple BAM files, depending on the amount of chromosomes specified in config.yaml.
        Each file contains the reads of one chromosome.
    
    Params:
        out_dir: the path pointing towards the output directory, used as a stub by bamtools split.
        
    Shadow: 
        Full, creates a temporary environment to store the output values of bamtools split.
        Allows unused chromosome seperated BAM files to be discarded.
    
    Shell clarification:
        bamtools split -in <input>
        -reference (to separate by chromosome) 
        -stub <prefix/directory of output path>"
