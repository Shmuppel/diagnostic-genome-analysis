def get_sample_from_wildcard(wildcards):
    """
    Retrieves the files associated from a sample stored in config.yaml.
    Which sample/file to retrieve is based on the wildcard passed as an argument to this function
    either manually or dynamically through 'input = get_sample_from_wildcard'.

    This function (as does the whole pipeline) assumes 2 paired end reads files per sample are stored
    with file name formatting: '{sample}_R1.fastq', ''{sample}_R2.fastq'.
