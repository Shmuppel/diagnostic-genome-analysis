def get_sample_from_wildcard(wildcards):
    """
    Retrieves the files associated from a sample stored in config.yaml.
    Which sample/file to retrieve is based on the wildcard passed as an argument to this function
    either manually or dynamically through 'input = get_sample_from_wildcard'.

    This function (as does the whole pipeline) assumes 2 paired end reads files per sample are stored
    with file name formatting: '{sample}_R1.fastq', ''{sample}_R2.fastq'.

rule trimmomatic:
    """  
    Trims reads, removes ILLUMINACLIP artifacts, and removes low length reads.

    Input: 
        Two FASTAQ files. Trimmomatic is set to use paired end trimming both forward and reverse reads 
        are expected to be present.
        
    Output: 
        Trimmed sequence reads. Reads that did not make the cut have been moved to unpaired archieves 
        (1U and 2U).
        
    Threads:
        2, although trimmomatic supports multithreading its implementation is not significantly 
        effective past 2 threads. For multiple samples 2 threads per sample revolves to multiple 
        trimmomatic rules being able to run at a relatively fast runtime. When dealing with 
        notably large files, such that runtime exacerbates, splitting the input files into batches
        would be an effective solution.
